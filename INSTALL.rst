   :local:

Ensure you have first read the :doc:`prerequisites <prereqs>` for understanding and using |MESSAGEix|.
These include specific points of knowledge that are necessary to understand these instructions and choose among different installation options.

Install system dependencies
===========================

GAMS (required)
---------------

|MESSAGEix| requires `GAMS`_.

1. Download GAMS for your operating system; either the `latest version`_ or, for users not familiar with GAMS licenses, `version 29`_ (see note below).

2. Run the installer.

3. Ensure that the ``PATH`` environment variable on your system includes the path to the GAMS program:

   - on Windows, in the GAMS installer…

      - Check the box labeled “Use advanced installation mode.”
      - Check the box labeled “Add GAMS directory to PATH environment variable” on the Advanced Options page.

   - on macOS, in the GAMS installer…

      - When prompted to specify the "Installation Type" (step 3 of the installation process), select "Customise".
      - Check the box labeled "Add GAMS to PATH".

	If this option is not available see instructions below.

   - on other platforms (macOS or Linux), add the following line to a file such as :file:`~/.bash_profile` (macOS), :file:`~/.bashrc`, or :file:`~/.profile`::

       $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/gams-directory-with-gams-binary

.. note::
   MESSAGE-MACRO and MACRO require GAMS 24.8.1 or later (see :attr:`.MACRO.GAMS_min_version`)
   The latest version is recommended.

   GAMS is proprietary software and requires a license to solve optimization problems.
   To run both the :mod:`message_ix` and :mod:`ixmp` tutorials and test suites, a “free demonstration” license is required; the free license is suitable for these small models.
   Versions of GAMS up to `version 29`_ include such a license with the installer; since version 30, the free demo license is no longer included, but may be requested via the GAMS website.

.. note::
   If you only have a license for an older version of GAMS, install both the older and the latest versions.


Graphviz (optional)
-------------------

:meth:`.reporting.Reporter.visualize` uses `Graphviz`_, a program for graph visualization.
Installing message_ix causes the python :mod:`graphviz` package to be installed.
If you want to use :meth:`.visualize` or run the test suite, the Graphviz program itself must also be installed; otherwise it is **optional**.

If you install MESSAGEix `Using Anaconda`_, Graphviz is installed automatically via `its conda-forge package`_.
For other methods of installation, see the `Graphviz download page`_ for downloads and instructions for your system.


Install |MESSAGEix|
===================

After installing GAMS, we recommend that new users install Anaconda, and then use it to install |MESSAGEix|.
Advanced users may choose to install |MESSAGEix| using ``pip``, or from source code (next sections).
If you are not doing this, then skip those sections.

Using Anaconda
--------------

.. note:: This section is also available as a narrated video on the `IIASA YouTube channel`_.
   If you are a beginner, you may want to watch the video before attempting the installation yourself.

4. Install Python via either `Miniconda`_ or `Anaconda`_. [1]_
   We recommend the latest version; currently Python 3.10. [2]_

5. Open a command prompt.
   Windows users should use the “Anaconda Prompt” to avoid issues with permissions and environment variables when installing and using |MESSAGEix|.
   This program is available in the Windows Start menu after installing Anaconda.

6. Configure conda to install :mod:`message_ix` from the conda-forge channel [3]_::

    $ conda config --prepend channels conda-forge

7. Create a new conda environment and activate it.
   This step is **required** if using Anaconda, but *optional* if using Miniconda.
   This example uses the name ``message_env``, but you can use any name of your choice::

    $ conda create --name message_env
    $ conda activate message_env

8. Install the ``message-ix`` package into the current environment (either e.g. ``message_env``, or another name from step 7) [4]_::

    $ conda install message-ix

Again: at this point, installation is complete.
You do not need to complete the steps in “Using ``pip``” or “From source”.
Go to the section `Check that installation was successful`_.

.. [1] See the `conda glossary`_ for the differences between Anaconda and Miniconda, and the definitions of the terms ‘channel’ and ‘environment’ here.
.. [2] On newer macOS systems with "Apple M1" processors: the Miniconda or Anaconda installers provided for M1 lead to errors in ixmp.
   Instead, we recommend to use the macOS installers for "x86_64" processors on these systems.
   See also `ixmp issue 473<https://github.com/iiasa/ixmp/issues/473>`_.
.. [3] The ‘$’ character at the start of these lines indicates that the command text should be entered in the terminal or prompt, depending on the operating system.
   Do not retype the ‘$’ character itself.
.. [4] Notice that conda uses the hyphen (‘-’) in package names, different from the underscore (‘_’) used in Python when importing the package.
.. note:: When using Anaconda (not Miniconda), steps (5) through (8) can also be performed using the graphical Anaconda Navigator.
   See the `Anaconda Navigator documentation`_ for how to perform the various steps.


Using ``pip``
-------------

`pip`_ is Python's default package management system.
If you install Anaconda (step 4, above), then ``pip`` is also usable.
``pip`` can also be used when Python is installed directly, *without* using Anaconda.

4. Ensure ``pip`` is installed—with Anaconda, or according to the pip documentation.

5. Open a command prompt and run::

    $ pip install message_ix


From source
-----------

4. Install :doc:`ixmp <ixmp:install>` from source.

5. (Optional) If you intend to contribute changes to |MESSAGEix|, first register a Github account, and fork the `message_ix repository <https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix>`_.
   This will create a new repository ``<user>/message_ix``.
   (Please also see :doc:`contributing`.)

6. Clone either the main repository, or your fork; using the `Github Desktop`_ client, or the command line::

    $ git clone git@github.com:iiasa/message_ix.git

    # or:
    $ git clone git@github.com:USER/message_ix.git

7. Open a command prompt in the ``message_ix`` directory and type::

    $ pip install --editable .[docs,reporting,tests,tutorial]

   The ``--editable`` flag ensures that changes to the source code are picked up every time :code:`import message_ix` is used in Python code.
   The ``[docs,reporting,tests,tutorial]`` extra requirements ensure additional dependencies are installed.

8. (Optional) If you will be using :file:`MESSAGE_master.gms` outside of Python :mod:`message_ix` to run |MESSAGEix|, you will likely modify this file, but will not want to commit these changes to Git.
   Set the Git “assume unchanged” bit for this file::

    $ git update-index --assume-unchanged message_ix/model/MESSAGE_master.gms

   To unset the bit, use ``--no-assume-unchanged``.
   See the `Git documentation`_ for more details.

9. (Optional) If installed from source, run the built-in test suite to check that |MESSAGEix| functions correctly on your system::

    $ pytest


Check that installation was successful
======================================

Verify that the version installed corresponds to the `latest release`_ by running the following commands on the command line::

    # Show versions of message_ix, ixmp, and key dependencies
    $ message-ix show-versions

    # Show the list of modelling platforms that have been installed and the path to the database config file
    # By default, just the local database should appear in the list
    $ message-ix platform list

The above commands will work as of :mod:`message_ix` 3.0 and in subsequent versions.
If an error occurs, this may mean that an older version has been installed and should be updated.
To check the current version::

    # If installed using conda
    $ conda list message-ix

    # If installed using pip
    $ pip show message-ix


.. _install-r:

Install R and reticulate
========================

You only need to install R if you want to use :mod:`message_ix` and :mod:`ixmp` from R, rather than from Python.

First, install :mod:`message_ix` using one of the three methods above.
Then:

1. `Install R <https://www.r-project.org>`_.

   .. warning::
      Ensure the the R version installed is either 32- *or* 64-bit (and >= 3.5.0), consistent with GAMS and Java.
      Having both 32- and 64-bit versions of R, or mixed 32- and 64-bit versions of different packages, can cause errors.

2. `Install reticulate <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/#installation>`_.

3. (Optional) Install `IRkernel`_, which allows running R code in Jupyter notebooks (see the link for instructions).

Next:

- See :doc:`rmessageix` for further details.

- If you installed :mod:`message_ix` from source, check that the R interface works by using the built-in test suite to run the R tutorial notebooks::

    $ pytest -m rmessageix


Common issues
=============

“No JVM shared library file (jvm.dll) found”
--------------------------------------------

Error messages like this when running ``message-ix --platform=default list`` or when creating a :class:`.Platform` object (e.g. :code:`ixmp.Platform()` in Python) indicate that :mod:`message_ix` (via :mod:`ixmp` and JPype) cannot find Java on your machine, in particular the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
There are multiple ways to resolve this issue:

1. If you have installed Java manually, ensure that the ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable is set system-wide; see for example `these instructions`_ for Windows users.
2. If using Anaconda, install the ``openjdk`` package in the same environment as the ``message-ix`` package.
   When the Windows Anaconda Prompt is opened, ``conda activate`` then ensures the ``JAVA_HOME`` variable is correctly set.

To check which JVM will be used by ixmp, run the following in any prompt or terminal::

    $ python -c "import jpype; print(jpype.getDefaultJVMPath())"


“No module named 'pyam'”
------------------------

The package `pyam-iamc <https://pypi.org/project/pyam-iamc/>`_ is one of the "reporting" extra dependencies of :mod:`message_ix`.
These extra dependencies are not installed automatically, but can be installed using::

    # If message_ix is installed using pip
    $ pip install message_ix[reporting]
    # or
    $ pip install pyam-iamc

    # If message_ix is installed using Anaconda (see note below)
    $ conda install pyam

Note that this package has the *different* name on conda-forge versus PyPI: `pyam <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyam>`__.

The package listed as `pyam <https://pypi.org/project/pyam/>`__ on PyPI (and not available via Anaconda) is unrelated to :mod:`message_ix`, not compatible with it, and will produce other error messages.
If you installed this package accidentally, remove it using::

    # If installed using pip
    $ pip uninstall pyam
