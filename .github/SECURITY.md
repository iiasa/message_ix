# Security Policy

As careful and community-oriented maintainers, we strive to keep our code safe to use for everyone. 
For this purpose, we highly value your input and will acknowledge your contributions as best we can.

## Supported Versions

Unfortunately, our team size does not permit us to support multiple versions at once. 
We generally develop our `main` branch and so to get the version of our code that contains all currently available security updates, please [install our code from source](https://docs.messageix.org/en/latest/install-adv.html#install-from-github) using the `main` branch. 
Please reach out to us if you encounter any issues in doing so.

If this is not an option, please ensure you are using the [latest release of our code](https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix/releases) to profit from as many security updates as possible.
We strive to publish new releases at least twice a year, so there should never be too many security updates pending.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Adivsory ["Report a vulnerability"](https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix/security/advisories/new) tab.
We will try to respond to your report as soon as possible with our and your next steps.
If you wish, we will keep you informed about any progress until the vulnerability is fixed.
