Description: MESSAGEix is a versatile, open-source, dynamic
    systems-optimization model. It was developed for strategic energy planning
    and integrated assessment of energy-engineering-economy-environment (E4)
    systems. The framework includes the possibility for integration with the
    general-economy MACRO model to incorporate the feedback from price changes
    on demand for commodities or energy services.
