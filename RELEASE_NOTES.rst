v2.0.0 (2020-01-14)
===================

message_ix v2.0.0 coincides with ixmp v2.0.0.

Migration notes
---------------

Support for **Python 2.7 is dropped** as it has reached end-of-life, meaning no further releases will be made even to fix bugs.
See `PEP-0373 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/>`_ and https://python3statement.org.
``message_ix`` users must upgrade to Python 3.

**Command-line interface (CLI).** Use ``message-ix`` as the program for all command-line operations:

- ``message-ix copy-model`` replaces ``messageix-config``.
- ``message-ix dl`` replaces ``messageix-dl``.
- ``message-ix`` also provides all the features of the :mod:`ixmp` CLI.

**Configuration.** ixmp adds a streamlined system for storing information about different platforms, backends, and databases that store Scenario data.
See the :doc:`ixmp release notes <ixmp:whatsnew>` for migration notes.

v1.2.0 (2019-06-25)
===================

MESSAGEix 1.2.0 adds an option to set the commodity balance to strict equality,
rather than a supply > demand inequality. It also improves the support for
models with non-equidistant years.

Other improvements include an experimental reporting module, support for CPLEX
solver options via :meth:`~.Scenario.solve`, and a reusable :mod:`message_ix.testing`
module.

Release 1.2.0 coincides with ixmp
`release 0.2.0 <https://github.com/iiasa/ixmp/releases/tag/v0.2.0>`_, which
provides full support for :meth:`~.Scenario.clone` across platforms (database
instances), e.g. from a remote database to a local HSQL database; as well as
other improvements. See the ixmp release notes for further details.

v1.1.0 (2018-11-21)
===================

Migration notes
---------------

This patch introduces a few backwards-incompatible changes to database management.

Database Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see an error message like::

    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
    usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ixmp/core.py:81: in __init__
        self._jobj = java.ixmp.Platform("Python", dbprops)
    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

    self = <jpype._jclass.at.ac.iiasa.ixmp.Platform object at 0x7ff1a8e98410>
    args = ('Python', '/tmp/kH07wz/test.properties')

        def _javaInit(self, *args):
            object.__init__(self)

            if len(args) == 1 and isinstance(args[0], tuple) \
               and args[0][0] is _SPECIAL_CONSTRUCTOR_KEY:
                self.__javaobject__ = args[0][1]
            else:
                self.__javaobject__ = self.__class__.__javaclass__.newClassInstance(
    >               *args)
    E           org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayExceptionPyRaisable: org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException: Validate failed: Migration checksum mismatch for migration 1
    E           -> Applied to database : 1588531206
    E           -> Resolved locally    : 822227094

Then you need to update your local database. There are two methods to do so:

1. Delete it (you will lose all data and need to regenerate it). The default
   location is ~/.local/ixmp/localdb/.
2. Manually apply the underlying migrations. This is not particularly easy, but
   allows you to save all your data. If you want help, feel free to get in
   contact on the
   `listserv <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/message_ix>`_.

New Property File Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see an error message like::

    usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/jpype/_jclass.py:111: at.ac.iiasa.ixmp.exceptions.IxExceptionPyRaisable

        @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
        def test_mp():
            test_props = create_local_testdb()

            # start jvm
            ixmp.start_jvm()

            # launch Platform and connect to testdb (reconnect if closed)
    >       mp = ixmp.Platform(test_props)

Then you need to update your property configuration file. The old file looks like::

    config.name = message_ix_test_db@local
    jdbc.driver.1 = org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
    jdbc.url.1 = jdbc:hsqldb:file:/path/to/database
    jdbc.user.1 = ixmp
    jdbc.pwd.1 = ixmp
    jdbc.driver.2 = org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
    jdbc.url.2 = jdbc:hsqldb:file:/path/to/database
    jdbc.user.2 = ixmp
    jdbc.pwd.2 = ixmp

The new file should look like::

    config.name = message_ix_test_db@local
    jdbc.driver = org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
    jdbc.url = jdbc:hsqldb:file:/path/to/database
    jdbc.user = ixmp
    jdbc.pwd = ixmp
