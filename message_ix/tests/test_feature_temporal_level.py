"""Ensure that COMMODITY_BALANCE works for models with sub-annual time resolution.

The tests check at different temporal levels, i.e., year, seasons, months, etc., and
with different duration_time values.

In these tests, "demand" is defined in different time slices with different
"duration_time", there is one power plant ("gas_ppl") to meet "demand", which receives
fuel from a supply technology ("gas_supply"). Different temporal level hierarchies are
tested, by linkages of "ACT" with "demand" and "CAP".
