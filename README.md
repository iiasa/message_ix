## Overview

MESSAGEix is a versatile, open-source, dynamic systems-optimization model.
It was developed for strategic energy planning and integrated assessment of
energy-engineering-economy-environment (E4) systems. The framework includes the
possibility for integration with the general-economy MACRO model to incorporate
the feedback from price changes on demand for commodities or energy services.
The mathematical formulation is based on the MESSAGE Integrated Assessment
model developed at IIASA since the 1980s.

The MESSAGEix and MACRO models are implemented in [GAMS](http://www.gams.com).
This repository contains the GAMS code and a number of tutorials and examples
using stylized national energy system models.

The MESSAGEix framework is fully integrated with IIASA's
[ix modeling platform (ixmp)](https://www.github.com/iiasa/ixmp),
a data warehouse for high-powered numerical scenario analysis.

## Getting started

### Documentation

[Documentation of the MESSAGEix framework](https://docs.messageix.org/),
including the complete mathematical formulation and associated files, is
automatically created from mark-up comments in the GAMS, Python, and R code.
The online documentation is synchronized with the contents of the master branch
of the [message_ix Github repository](https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix).

For offline use, the documentation can be built from the source code.
See `doc/README.md` for further details.


### Installation

See [‘Installation’ in the documentation](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/getting_started.html) or the file `INSTALL.rst`.


### Tutorials

Several introductory tutorials are provided.
See [‘Tutorials’ in the documentation](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/tutorials.html) or the file
`tutorial/README.rst`.
