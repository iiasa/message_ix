MESSAGEix is a versatile, dynamic systems-optimization modeling framework developed by the IIASA Energy Program since the 1980s.

MESSAGE is a specific mathematical formulation of a model for strategic energy planning and integrated assessment of energy-engineering-economy-environment (E4) systems.
The linear-programming optimization model can be be linked to the general-equilibrium MACRO model to incorporate feedback between prices and demand levels for energy and commodities.

The `message_ix` Python package includes [GAMS](http://www.gams.com) implementations of MESSAGE, MACRO, and their linkage, along with scientific programming APIs and tools for model-building, a test suite, and documentation.
The framework is built on IIASA's [*ix* modeling platform (ixmp)](https://github.com/iiasa/ixmp), which provides data warehouse features for high-powered numerical scenario analysis.

## Getting started

### Documentation

[Documentation of the MESSAGEix framework](https://docs.messageix.org/),
including the complete mathematical formulation and associated files, is
automatically created from mark-up comments in the GAMS, Python, and R code.

- Documentation for the ‘latest’ or ‘stable’ release is shown by default.
- Use the chooser to reach the [docs for the ``master`` branch](https://docs.messageix.org/en/master) of the GitHub repository, including the latest development code.
- For offline use, the documentation can be built from the source code.
  See the file `doc/README.rst`.

### Installation

See [the online documentation](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/#getting-started) or the file `INSTALL.rst`.

### Tutorials

For formal and self-guided learning, introductory tutorials are provided that
illustrate the basic features of the modelling framework using simplified, single-country models.
See [‘Tutorials’ in the documentation](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/tutorials.html) or the file `tutorial/README.rst`.
