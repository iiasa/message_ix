    "# Westeros Tutorial - Trade in multi-node energy systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how a multinode energy system can be built using the *MESSAGEix* framework. The aim of this tutorial is to show:\n",
    "\n",
    "- how new nodes can be added to a model and how data can be populated for those new nodes\n",
    "- how a trade hub can be represented\n",
    "- how bilateral trade can be modeled\n",
    "- the role of the `message_ix` index set \"mode\" in representing trade links\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites for running this tutorial**\n",
    "- You have the *MESSAGEix* framework installed and working.\n",
    "- You have run Westeros baseline scenario (``westeros_baseline.ipynb``) and solved it successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial was presented by [Behnam Zakeri](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/behnam-zakeri) at the **MESSAGEix Community Meeting** May 2022. Please feel free to suggest improvements through issues and pull-requests."

    "###  3.3. Role of trade\n",
    "The results of activity (`ACT`) show that the electricity trade is in the mode of \"S-to-W\", i.e., from Stepstones to Westeros, in the bi-directional line. Stepstones is the exporter as demand for lighting is the lowest in this node, while the potential supply technologies are the same. Hence, the relatively cheaper electricity can be exported to Westeros with higher demand. Further, Westeros exports to Essos, as the latter has the highest demand for electricity. Here, Westeros is acting as an intermediate node in the trade network to pass electricity from Stepstones to Essos, of course with additional losses. Because there is no trade possibilities between Stepstones and Essos directly.\n",

    "### Exercise: Trade with an external market/system\n",
    "We demonstrated the possibilites for a hub-based and bilateral trade representation in MESSAGEix. In some case studies, a trade link needs to be facilitated with an external market or system, e.g., to neighbouring nodes or to the world outside of the boundary of the modeled nodes. This is very common, as it is not possible or desirable to model all neighbouring regions or the external system, and a model needs to be limited to a certain boundary. Hence, each node individually and/or the hub can be linked to an external market (e.g., to global commodity markets represented at \"World\").\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='_static\\external.JPG'>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you should establish trade with an external market in the Westeros multi-node model. This trade link can be through a hub or directly from a node. You can specify the price of electricity ($/kWa) in the external market in 700-720 as follows: {700: 97, 710: 93, 720: 87}.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Hint: we can model this with an importing technology that imports electricity to the node \"hub\". This technology, however, has no `input` parameter (because we do not model the commodity balance outside of the boundary of our model). However, we can define `var_cost` for this trade link to represent the price of commodity in the external market.)\n",
