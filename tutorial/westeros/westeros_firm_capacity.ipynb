    "# Westeros Tutorial - Adding representation of renewables (part1/3): Introducing `\"firm capacity\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to apply various features of the MESSAGEix formulation to provide a more realistic representation of renewable energy integration in the energy system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this series of tutorials, we show how to ensure that in a model setup which does not use sub-annual timesteps, and therefore does not depict peak load, we can still account for [`\"firm capacity\"`](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/model_core.html?highlight=FIRM_CAPACITY_PROVISION#equation-firm-capacity-provision). In power systems, firm or reliable capacity means sufficient power capacity from different electricity generation plants is available to maintain system reliability through reasonable load and contingency events.\n",

    "**Pre-requisites**\n",

    "For systems across the U.S., load duration curves are similar from one location to another. Based on load data it was calculated that the peak load is, on average, 1.7 times the average load (a load factor of 59%). As illustrated in the figure below, when coupled with a standard reserve margin of 15â€“20% of peak load, firm capacity requirements for the U.S. should be roughly twice average load.

    "### Ensuring enough firm capacity\n",
    "Toward meeting the firm capacity requirement, conventional generating technologies contribute their nameplate generation capacity (see figure above). \n",
    "\n",
    "This therefore implies that for conventional power plants i.e., for `\"coal_ppl\"`, a `\"reliability_factor\"` of 1 defines the `\"rating_bin\"` (the maximum share of technology in commodity use per rating) with [`rating=\"firm\"`](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/parameter_def.html?highlight=rating_bin#input-output-mapping-costs-and-engineering-specifications). This is predefined as part of the model formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to account for the integration challenge at higher shares of variable renewables, their contribution to the capacity requirements i.e., their capacity value, declines as the market share of the technology increases. \n",
    "We therefore assume, that up to a share of 20% of the total electricity supply, the capacity of `\"wind_ppl\"` adds by 80% to the firm capacity of the power system. This means `value=0.2` of the `\"rating_bin\"` and `value=0.8` of the `\"reliability_factor\"`, defined as `rating=\"r1\"`. The remaining 80% of the installed capacity contribute to 5% to the firm capacity, and is defined as `rating=\"r2\"`. "
