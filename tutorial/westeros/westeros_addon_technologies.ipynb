    "# Westeros Tutorial - Introducing `\"addon\"` technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to establish an inter-dependency between two technologies by configuring one of them as `\"addon\"`  to another one, i.e., parent technology. This can be used to model additional technology features such as carbon-capture-and-storage (CCS) retrofits, passout-turbines (for optional heat cogeneration) or cooling technologies, to existing technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to tackle this issue. Lets take the example of a coal power plant (`\"coal_ppl\"`). All of the above mentioned additional features could be implemented by introducing different *modes* of operation for `\"coal_ppl\"`. For example, heat cogeneration could be implemented as a separate operation `\"mode\"` of `\"coal_ppl\"`, where instead of just generating electricity, heat can also be produced at the cost of reducing the amount of electricity generated. Another approach would make use of the generic `\"relations\"` in MESSAGEix, therefore linking the newly added technology representing the passout-turbine with the activity of `\"coal_ppl\"`. Both of these approaches have some downsides. Using a separate `\"mode\"` will not permit explicitly modelling investment costs and lifetime associated with the asset being added to `\"coal_ppl\"`. Generic relations are very flexible, but if too many of them are added, the model becomes very hard to understand. MESSAGEix offers an explicit `\"addon\"` formulation for tackling this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional technology options are explicitly modelled as separate technologies, classified as `\"addon\"` technologies, linked to the activity of the technology to which they serve as additional configuration options, i.e., the parent technology. Through an `\"addon_conversion\"` factor, the activity of `\"addon\"` technology can further be restricted to a minimum or maximum share of the activity of the parent technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites for running this tutorial**\n",
    "- You have the *MESSAGEix* framework installed and working\n",
    "- You have run Westeros baseline scenario (`westeros_baseline.ipynb`) and solved it successfully"

The lifetime is assumed to be 30 years, 10 years longer then that of `\"coal_ppl\"`.  Investment costs are 150\\\\$/kW compared to 500\\\\$/kW for `\"coal_ppl\"`.  A coal heatplant would have higher investment costs, approximately double that of \"po_turbine\". Lastly, `\"po_turbine\"` represents an alternative production mode of `\"coal_ppl\"`, hence in order to produce heat, the electricity of `\"coal_ppl\"` is reduced. Thus, electricity is parametrized as an input to `\"po_turbine\"`; for each unit of electricity, 5 units of heat can be produced. This will later also be used for establishing a \"link\" between `\"coal_ppl\"` and `\"po_turbine\"`.\n",

    "### Answer to the question:\n",
    "In the new scenario ('*addon_technology*'), the effects of the addon technology can be seen when comparing the activity to the baseline scenario ('*baseline*'). From 700 onwards, the activity of the `\"wind_ppl\"` has increased to compensate for the electricity required from the `\"coal_ppl\"` for use in the `\"po_turbine\"`. In 720, when the `\"wind_ppl\"` is phased out, more electricity is required to be produced by the `\"coal_ppl\"`. "
