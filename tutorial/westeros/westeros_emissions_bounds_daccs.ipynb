    "# Adding DACCS in MESSAGE\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, we have learnt how to create a baseline scenario (`westeros_baseline.ipynb`) and add emissions bounds (`westeros_emissions_bounds.ipynb`) to the baseline scenario. Here, we will show how to include an additional/new technology to a MESSAGE model. While the combination of currently existing technologies might be able to deliver the Paris targets, the deployment of some new technologies might improve the probability of meeting the targets and/or reducing the costs. These technologies include CO2 removal (CDR) technologies. Hence, in this tutorial, we will use direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) as an example of new technologies to be considered in climate mitigation pathways. \n",

    "In order to smoothly follow this tutorial, you have to alrady have the MESSAGEix framework installed and working. Moreover, you should have run the Westeros baseline and emissions bounds scenarios successfully as this tutorial is built on top of those scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all set, we can start by importing all the packages we need and connect to a database that store the scenario input and results. We can also name the model as `Westeros Electrified` here."
