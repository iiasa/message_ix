    "# Westeros Tutorial - Adding representation of renewables (part2/3): Introducing `\"flexible generation\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial, which demonstrates how to apply various model features to provide a more realistic representation of renewable energy integration in the energy system, is comprised of three parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part, we introduced [`\"firm capacity\"`](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/model_core.html?highlight=FIRM_CAPACITY_PROVISION#equation-firm-capacity-provision) constraints to ensure that conventional electricity generation plants supplied sufficient backup capacity to allow for a high share of renewable electricity generation. In this tutorial, we will address [`\"flexible generation\"`](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/model_core.html?highlight=flexibility#equation-system-flexibility-constraint) i.e., the ability of a power plant to ramp up and down its generation in response to the system needs. The power system needs to be flexible to respond to fluctuations in both electricity load and supply.\n",

    "\n",
    "Electric-sector flexibility is the ability of a power system to match supply and demand at any time scale. This characteristic can be represented in a stylized way as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "Each generating technology is assigned a coefficient between −1 and 1 representing (if positive) the fraction of generation from that technology that is considered to be flexible or (if negative) the additional flexible generation required for each unit of generation from that technology. A negative coefficient on load reveals a parameterization of the amount of flexible energy the system requires solely to meet changes and uncertainty in load. ([Sullivan et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2013.01.001))\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients used in this tutorial are derived in [Sullivan et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esr.2013.01.001).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Technology | Flexibility parameter |\n",

    "Based on the above listed coefficients, our `\"wind_ppl\"` will need flexibility equal to 8% of its activity. Likewise, the electricity grid has a flexibility need of 10%. `\"coal_ppl\"` can provide 15% of its activity as flexibility for meeting the system needs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the previous tutorial two `\"rating_bin\"`s were introduced for `\"wind_ppl\"`, depicting the different firm capacity requirements as market share increases.  We will again use the two rating bins previously defined. Here we make the assumption that the above flexibility parameter (8%) applies to the larger of the two rating bins (`\"r2\"`), and assume that the smaller rating bin (`\"r1\"`) has a lower flexibility demand of 6%, correlating to the fact that the first 20% of installed capacity required contributes more to firm capacity.
