    "\n",
    "This tutorial takes a closer look at the parameter [`\"historical_new_capacity\"`](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/parameter_def.html?highlight=historical_new_capacity#historical-capacity-and-activity-values).\n",
    "We will take a look at how MESSAGEix defines historical periods, and how to apply and parametrize one of the historical parameters, `\"historical_new_capacity\"`.\n",
    "We will further investigate the concept of early retirement i.e. the retirement of a powerplant before it reaches the end of its lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites**\n",
    "- You have the *MESSAGEix* framework installed and working\n",
    "- You have run Westeros baseline scenario (`westeros_baseline.ipynb`) and solved it successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the tutorial, we will load and subsequently clone the Westeros baseline scenario.\n",
    "The new scenario will be simplified in order to demonstrate how to parametrize `\"historical_new_capacity\"` for `\"coal_ppl\"`.\n",
    "In the second part, we will then add a cheaper electricity generation technology, `\"gas_ppl\"`, as shown in the figure below.  The `\"gas_ppl\"` will  demonstrate the early retirement of `\"coal_ppl\"`.\n",
    "Lastly, we will look at how to circumvent early retirement for a specific technology, should this be undesired.\n",

    "### A quick look at historical parameters and their purpose\n",
    "\"Historical parameters\" can only be set for \"historical time-periods\".\n",
    "The \"historical time-periods\" are all the years which have been defined prior to the `firstmodelyear`.\n",
    "These can be used for two purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For **calibration of the model**: The `firstmodelyear` is used to specify as of which time-period the \"optimization\" should be carried out.\n",
    "There will be some past dependencies though, such as technology investments, their activity or emissions amongst others.\n",
    "In order to account for these dependencies, we can use the parameters `\"historical_new_capacity\"`, `\"historical_capacity\"` and `\"historical_emissions\"` respectively.\n",
    "These will have implications on dynamic constraints on capacities or activity.\n",
    "In the case of emissions, `\"historical_emissions\"` can be accounted for in cumulative emission bounds.\n",
    "2. The second application is when running **complex scenario setups**.\n",
    "If for example the aim is to assess climate mitigation efforts based on achieving the NDCs in 2030, then two scenarios can be run.\n",
    "Scenario a) implements \"only\" the NDCs related policies up to 2030 (see dashed orange line *\\\"NDC\\\"* in the panel a. of the figure below).\n",
    "After 2030, there is no continuation of policies assumed, hence the model will return to a \"baseline\" trajectory (see solid blue line *\\\"Baseline\\\"* in the panel a. of the figure below).\n",
    "This scenario will then serve as a basis for further analysis - e.g. scenario b) (see red dashed line *\\\"NDC-mitigation\\\"* in panel b. in the figure below).\n",
    "In order to avoid an \"overachievement\" of the NDCs, the time-periods until 2030 should be *fixed*.\n",
    "The historical time-periods (see the extension of the grey block in panel b. in the figure below) are therefore shifted.\n",
    "This can be done in the process of cloning the NDC scenario for use with mitigation runs.\n",
    "In the process of [cloning](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/api.html?highlight=clone#message_ix.Scenario.clone) a scenario, the argument `shift_first_model_year=<year>` with the corresponding time-period can be passed.\n",
    "In the process of cloning the scenario, for the example below, all time-periods prior to 2035 will be set to \"historical\" time-periods and its solutions will be transferred to historical_activity and `\"historical_new_capacity\"`. So the results (\"VAR\" - solved variables e.g. the activity-level) for those years will be added to the corresponding \"historical\" parameters.\n",
