    "# Westeros Tutorial - Introducing soft constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In the baseline tutorial, we added dynamic constraints on activity via the parameter `\"growth_activity_up\"` for the electricity generation technologies. As a result, when we added an emission tax, `\"wind_ppl\"` was scaled up at the maximum rate of 10% annually in the last period.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to explore how to provide additional flexibility to the dynamic growth constraints. We will explore so-called [`soft constraints`](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/parameter_def.html?highlight=soft%20constraint#dynamic-constraints-on-new-capacity-and-activity). Soft constraints can be configured to provide a relaxation for both activity and capacity related dynamic constraints. At a certain cost, additional annual growth rate can be realized. The cost can be absolute or defined as a share of the levelized cost (see details [here](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/parameter_def.html?highlight=soft%20constraint#cost-parameters-for-soft-relaxations-of-dynamic-constraints)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing this additional flexibility to dynamic constraints can be useful for assessing mitigation pathways. While without these e.g. certain emission targets may not be achievable, the additional flexibility provided reflects the fact that investments i.e. technology diffusion, can be realized faster taking into account higher costs. This can provide interesting insights as to where additional subsidies or policies can help pursue more ambitious targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further information can be found in [Kepp and Strubegger, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2010.01.019). \n",

    "**Pre-requisites**\n",
    "- You have the *MESSAGEix* framework installed and working\n",
    "- You have run Westeros tutorial on emission taxes (`westeros_emissions_taxes.ipynb`) and solved it successfully"

    "\n",
    "Recall that when setting up the Westeros baseline scenario, we added the parameter `\"growth_activity_up\"` for `\"wind_ppl\"`, with a value of 10%. As the growth rate is an annual value and the duration of the periods in this example are 10 years, activity within a single period can increase by a maximum of 259% ((1 + .10)^10).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now add a soft constraint for the year 720, allowing additional growth of up to 1% per year. This means that activity can increase by a maximum of 259% + 10% (((1 + .01)^10) - 1). The costs will be defined in relative terms i.e. relative to the [levelized cost](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/scaling_investment_costs.html?highlight=levelized%20cost#levelized-capital-costs). By specifying the `\"level_cost_activity_soft_up\"` as 1%, we are defining that per unit of activity from the previous period, used to determine the allowable additional activity, 1% of the `levelized_cost` are applied (see [link](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/model/MESSAGE/model_core.html#objective-function) for more information)."
