    "# Westeros Tutorial - Introducing reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "‘Reporting’ is the term used in the MESSAGEix ecosystem to refer to any calculations performed _after_ the MESSAGE mathematical optimization problem has been solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the reporting features provided by the ``ixmp`` and ``message_ix`` packages.\n",
    "It was developed by Paul Natsuo Kishimoto ([@khaeru](https://github.com/khaeru)) for a MESSAGEix training workshop held at IIASA in October 2019.\n",
    "Participants in the MESSAGEix workshops of June and September 2020 contributed feedback.\n",
    "<!-- Add a line here if you revise the tutorial! -->\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites**\n",
    "- You have the *MESSAGEix* framework installed and working\n",
    "  In particular, you should have installed ``message_ix[report]``, which requires ``ixmp[report]``, ``genno[compat]``, and ``plotnine``\n",
    "- Complete tutorial Part 1 (``westeros_baseline.ipynb``)\n",
    "  - Understand the following MESSAGEix terms: ‘variable’, ‘parameter’\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "### What does ‘reporting’ include?\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual modelers will make different distinctions between—on one hand—the internals of an optimization model and—on the other—reporting, ‘post-processing’, ‘analysis’, and other tasks.\n",
    "Doing valid research using models like MESSAGE requires that we understand these differences clearly, as well as how we choose to communicate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might say: “The MESSAGE model shows that total secondary energy (electricity) output in Westeros in the year 720 is 9 GWa.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we are using the model from `westeros_baseline.ipynb`:\n",
    "1. The raw data from the `Scenario`, after `.solve()` has been called, **only** tells us the `\"ACT\"` variable has certain values.\n",
    "2. To get the 9 GWa figure, we must:\n",
    "   1. Compute the product of activity (`\"ACT\"`, which is dimensionless) and output efficiency (`\"output\"` in GWa/year), then\n",
    "   2. Sum across the `\"technology\"` dimension, and finally\n",
    "   3. Select the single value for the `\"year\"` 720.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In this example, steps A, B, and C under #2 are part of ‘reporting’.\n",
    "Even an intuitive concept like “total secondary energy” is not a *direct* output of the model, but must be reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we may want to create a plot of electricity output by year.\n",
    "Some modelers consider this part of ‘reporting’; for others, ‘reporting’ is complete when the values needed for the plot are written to a file, which they can then use with their favourite plotting tool."

    "## Reporting features in MESSAGEix\n",
    "\n",
    "The reporting features in ``ixmp`` and ``message_ix`` are developed to support the complicated reporting and multiple workflows required by the IIASA ECE program for research projects involving large, detailed models such as the [MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM global model](https://docs.messageix.org/global/).\n",
    "While powerful enough for this purpose, they are also intended to be user-friendly, flexible, and customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core class used for reporting is ``message_ix.Reporter``, which extends the class ``ixmp.Reporter``.\n",
    "A reporting workflow has two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare** or describe all computations the Reporter may possibly handle, using ``Reporter.add()`` and other helper methods.\n",
    "2. **Execute** a subset of these computations using ``Reporter.get()``, in order to generate one or more quantities or reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-step process allows the Reporter to deliver good performance, by excluding unneeded computations and avoiding re-computing intermediate results that are used in multiple places."

    "## Concepts: The Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "``ixmp.Reporter`` is built around a **graph** of *nodes* and *edges*; specifically, a *directed, acyclic graph* (DAG).\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- Every edge has a direction; *from* one node *to* another.\n",
    "- There are no recursive loops in the graph; i.e. no node is its own ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the reporting graph, every **node** represents a numerical *calculation*—or, more generally, a *computation* (including other actions like manipulating data formats, writing files, etc.).\n",
    "The node is labeled with the name of the quantity it produces, which is called a **key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node's computation may depend on certain inputs.\n",
    "These are represented by the **edges** of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $C = A + B$\n",
    "\n",
    "…is represented by:\n",
    "- A node named \"A\" that provides the raw value of A.\n",
    "- A node named \"B\" that provides the raw value of B.\n",
    "- A node named \"C\" that computes a sum of its inputs.\n",
    "- An edge from \"A\" to \"C\", indicating that the value of A is an input to C.\n",
    "- An edge from \"B\" to \"C\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Reporter to describe this equation (step 1 in the 2-step workflow):"

    "- The remaining arguments describe the computation to be performed:\n",
    "  - For nodes \"A\" and \"B\", these are simply the raw or literal value to be produced by the node.\n",
    "  - For node \"C\" there are 3 items: ``add, \"A\", \"B\"``.\n",
    "    Let's break that down further:\n",
    "    - The first item, ``add``, is the literal name of a Python function that we have defined.\n",
    "      This function computes the \n",
    "    - The second item, `\"A\"` is a string giving the key for another node in the graph.\n",
    "    - Likewise, the third item.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have given the Reporter a series of instructions like \"In order to compute 'C', first compute 'A' and 'B', then run the function ``add()`` on their values.\" But **we have not actually executed** any of these.\n",
