    "# Westeros Tutorial - Introducing reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "‘Reporting’ is the term used in the MESSAGEix ecosystem to refer to any calculations performed _after_ the MESSAGE mathematical optimization problem has been solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the reporting features provided by the ``ixmp`` and ``message_ix`` packages.\n",
    "It was originally developed by Paul Natsuo Kishimoto ([@khaeru](https://github.com/khaeru)) for a MESSAGEix training workshop held at IIASA in October 2019.\n",
    "Participants in the MESSAGEix workshops of June and September 2020 contributed feedback.\n",
    "<!-- Add a line here if you revise the tutorial! -->\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-requisites**\n",
    "- Read the [‘Prerequisite knowledge & skills’ page in the MESSAGEix documentation](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/prereqs.html#scientific-computing-skills).\n",
    "  - In particular, this tutorial uses the basic Python concepts of [tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences) and [lambda expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions).\n",
    "- You have the *MESSAGEix* framework installed and working.\n",
    "  In particular, you should have installed ``message_ix[report]``, which requires ``ixmp[report]``, ``genno[compat]``, and ``plotnine``.\n",
    "- Complete tutorial Part 1 (``westeros_baseline.ipynb``).\n",
    "  - Understand the following MESSAGEix terms: ‘variable’, ‘parameter’.\n",
    "- Open the [‘Reporting’ page in the MESSAGEix documentation](https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/reporting.html);\n",
    "  bookmark it or keep it open in a tab.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "### What does ‘reporting’ include?\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual modelers will make different distinctions between—on one hand—the internals of an optimization model and—on the other—reporting, ‘post-processing’, ‘analysis’, and other tasks.\n",
    "Doing valid research using models like MESSAGE requires that we understand these differences clearly, as well as how we choose to communicate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might say:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The MESSAGE model shows that total secondary energy (electricity) output in Westeros in the year 720 is 9 GWa.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we are using the model from `westeros_baseline.ipynb`:\n",
    "1. The raw data from the `Scenario`, after `.solve()` has been called,\n",
    "   **only** tells us the $\\mathrm{ACT}$ variable has certain values.\n",
    "2. To get the “9 GWa” figure, we must:\n",
    "   1. Compute the product of activity ($\\mathrm{ACT}$, which is dimensionless) and output efficiency ($\\mathrm{output}$, in GWa/year), then\n",
    "   2. Sum across the $t$/`technology` dimension, and finally\n",
    "   3. Select the single value for the period ($y^A$/`year`) 720.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In this example, the steps under (2) are ‘reporting’.\n",
    "Even an intuitive concept like “total secondary energy” **is not a direct output** of the model:\n",
    "it must be reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we may want to create a plot of electricity output by year.\n",
    "Some modelers consider this part of ‘reporting’; for others, ‘reporting’ is complete when the values needed for the plot are written to a file, which they can then use with their favourite plotting tool."

    "## Reporting features in MESSAGEix\n",
    "\n",
    "The reporting features in ``ixmp`` and ``message_ix`` are developed to support the complicated reporting and multiple workflows required by the IIASA ECE Program for research projects involving large, detailed models such as the [MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM global model](https://docs.messageix.org/global/).\n",
    "While powerful enough for this purpose, they are also intended to be user-friendly, flexible, and customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main Python class used for reporting is `message_ix.Reporter`,\n",
    "which extends the classes `ixmp.Reporter` and `genno.Computer`.\n",
    "A reporting workflow has two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare** or describe all tasks the Reporter may possibly handle, using ``Reporter.add()`` and other helper methods.\n",
    "2. **Execute** a subset of these tasks using ``Reporter.get()``, in order to generate one or more quantities, files, reports, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-step process allows the Reporter to deliver good performance,\n",
    "by excluding unneeded tasks\n",
    "and storing intermediate results that are used in multiple places\n",

    "\n",
    "The Reporter is built around a **graph** of *nodes* and *edges*; specifically, a *directed, acyclic graph* (DAG).\n",
    "This is a simple and generic mathematical concept wherein:\n",
    "- Every edge has a direction; *from* one node *to* another.\n",
    "- There are no recursive loops in the graph; that is, no node is its own ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Reporter's graph, every **node** represents some kind of **task**.\n",
    "These can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numerical *calculation*.\n",
    "- Other *computations* like manipulating data formats, writing files, etc.\n",
    "- Simply collecting the outputs of 1 or more *other* nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The node is labeled with a unique name for the output, quantity, or effect it produces.\n",
    "We call this a **key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task represented by one node may depend on certain inputs that are outputs of other nodes.\n",
    "These output-to-input links are represented by the **edges** of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "> $C = A + B$\n",
    "\n",
    "…can be represented as:\n",
    "- A node named \"A\" that outputs the raw value of A.\n",
    "- A node named \"B\" that outputs the raw value of B.\n",
    "- A node named \"C\" that computes a sum of its inputs.\n",
    "- An edge from \"A\" to \"C\", indicating that the value of A is an input to C.\n",
    "- An edge from \"B\" to \"C\".\n",

    "1. They are **multi-dimensional**, with 1 or more *dimensions* and *labels* that identify *coordinates* along those dimensions such as specific time periods, technologies, etc.\n",
    "2. They are **sparse**: there is not necessarily a value for every possible combination of labels; and\n",
