This seasonality can be averaged out if the yearly values are taken into account. The capacity factor of wind is different in winter and summer, while it was an average yearly value in the baseline scenario. Without any bound or tax on emissions, coal is the cheapest option. Wind will be installed only when coal cannot ramp up quickly to meet the whole demand, mainly in winter. Therefore, we observe relatively much higher installed capacity for wind compared in this scenario to the baseline, even wind is more expensive. Thus, we see a more expensive system when considering seasonality (compare the objective values). "
