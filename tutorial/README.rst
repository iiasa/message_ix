Tutorials
*********

To get started with |MESSAGEix|, the following tutorials are provided as
`Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_, which combine code, sample output,
and explanatory text.

A static, non-interactive version of each notebook can be viewed online using
the links below. In order to execute the tutorial code or make modifications,
read the Preparation_ section, next.

Preparation
===========

Getting tutorial files
----------------------

If you installed |MESSAGEix| from source, all notebooks are in the ``tutorial``
directory.

If you installed |MESSAGEix| using Anaconda, download the notebooks using the
``message-ix`` command-line program. In a command prompt::

    $ message-ix dl /path/to/tutorials

.. note::

   If you installed :mod:`message_ix` into a specific conda environment, that
   environment must be active in order for your system to find the
   ``message-ix`` command-line program, and also to run the Jupyter notebooks.
   Activate the environment `as described`_ in the conda documentation; for
   instance, if you used the name ``message_env``::

     $ conda activate message_env

.. _as described: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment

.. note::

   By default, the tutorials for your installed version of |MESSAGEix| are
   downloaded. To download a different version, add e.g. ``--tag v1.2.0`` to
   the above command. To download the tutorials from the development version,
   add ``--branch master``.

Running tutorials
-----------------

Using Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``nb_conda`` package is required. It should be installed by default with
Anaconda. If it was not, install it::

    $ conda install nb_conda

1. Open “Jupyter Notebooks” from Anaconda's “Home” tab (or directly if you have
   the option).

2. Choose and open a tutorial notebook.

3. Each notebook requires a *kernel* that executes code interactively. Check
   that the kernel matches your conda environment, and if necessary change
   kernels with the menu, e.g. `Kernel` → `Change Kernel` → `Python
   [conda root]`.

From the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Navigate to the tutorial folder. For instance, if ``message-ix dl`` was used
   above::

       $ cd /path/to/tutorials

2. Start the Jupyter notebook::

       $ jupyter notebook

Westeros Electrified
====================

This tutorial demonstrates how to model a very simple energy system, and then
uses it to illustrate a range of framework features.

#. Build the baseline model (:tut:`westeros/westeros_baseline.ipynb`).

#. Add extra detail and constraints to the model

   #. Emissions

      #. Introduce emissions and a bound on the emissions
         (:tut:`westeros/westeros_emissions_bounds.ipynb`).
      #. Introduce taxes on emissions
         (:tut:`westeros/westeros_emissions_taxes.ipynb`).

   #. Renewables

      #. Represent both coal and wind electricity using a “firm capacity”
         formulation (:tut:`westeros/westeros_firm_capacity.ipynb`): each
         generation technology can supply some firm capacity, but the variable,
         renewable technology (wind) supplies less than coal.
      #. Represent coal and wind electricity using a different, “flexibility
         requirement” formulation
         (:tut:`westeros/westeros_flexible_generation.ipynb`), wherein wind
         *requires* and coal *supplies* flexibility.
      #. Add a renewable-resource supply curve for the wind power plant,
         (:tut:`westeros/westeros_renewable_resource.ipynb`).

   #. Variablity in energy supply and demand by adding sub-annual time steps,
      e.g. winter and summer (:tut:`westeros/westeros_seasonality.ipynb`).
   #. Using share constraints to depict policies, i.e. require renewables to
      supply a certain share of total electricity generation
      (:tut:`westeros/westeros_share_constraint.ipynb`).
   #. Add a fossil-resource supply curve for the coal power plant,
      (:tut:`westeros/westeros_fossil_resource.ipynb`).
   #. Add-on technologies: Add the possibility of co-generation for the coal
      power plant, by allowing it to produce heat via a passout-turbine
      (:tut:`westeros/westeros_addon_technologies.ipynb`).
   #. Build the baseline scenario using data stored in xlsx files to populate sets and
      parameters.

      #. Export data to and Excel file and import the data to create a new scenario
         (:tut:`westeros/westeros_baseline_using_xlsx_import_part1.ipynb`).
      #. Import data from multiple excel files to create a new scenario
         (:tut:`westeros/westeros_baseline_using_xlsx_import_part2.ipynb`).

   #. Add soft constraints for activity related dynamic constraints
      (:tut:`westeros/westeros_soft_constraints.ipynb`

   #. Explore historical parameters and their usage
      (:tut:`westeros/westeros_historical_new_capacity.ipynb`).
        
#. After the MESSAGE model has solved, use the :mod:`.message_ix.reporting`
   module to ‘report’ results, e.g. do post-processing, plotting, and other
   calculations (:tut:`westeros/westeros_report.ipynb`).


.. _austria-tutorials:

Austrian energy system
======================

This tutorial demonstrates a stylized representation of a national electricity
sector model, with several fossil and renewable power plant types.

#. Prepare the base model version, in Python
   (:tut:`Austrian_energy_system/austria.ipynb`)
   or in R (:tut:`Austrian_energy_system/R_austria.ipynb`).
#. Plot results, in Python
   (:tut:`Austrian_energy_system/austria_load_scenario.ipynb`)
   or in R (:tut:`Austrian_energy_system/R_austria_load_scenario.ipynb`).
#. Run a single policy scenario
   (:tut:`Austrian_energy_system/austria_single_policy.ipynb`).
#. Run multiple policy scenarios. This tutorial has two notebooks:

  - an introduction with some exercises
    (:tut:`Austrian_energy_system/austria_multiple_policies.ipynb`), and
  - completed code for the exercises
    (:tut:`Austrian_energy_system/austria_multiple_policies-answers.ipynb`).
