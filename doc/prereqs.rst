Basic usage
===========

Domain knowledge
----------------
You should be able to:

1. Understand mathematical optimization, linear programming, and/or the calculus underlying these.
2. Understand concepts including:

   - Energy systems, including their components: resources, supply-side technologies, demand and end-use.
   - Levels (such as primary or secondary energy) in an energy system.
   - Efficiency of energy use or transformation.
   - Costs, including the distinction between fixed costs, variable costs, and investment costs.

Scientific computing skills
---------------------------
You should be able to:

1. Install and uninstall software on your operating system (OS): one of Linux, Windows, or macOS.

2. Use a command line on your OS to navigate directories and files, run commands, and view their output.

3. Modify environment variables on your OS.

4. Write simple programs in Python or R, including:

   - Understand concepts including: variables, functions, and arguments.
   - Use control flow structures such as ``if`` statements and various types of loops.
   - Access and read the documentation for the core language.
   - Use a search engine to find code examples and to diagnose error messages.

   For Python, `Dive Into Python <https://diveinto.org/python3/table-of-contents.html>`_ is one beginner resource.
   Many free and paid online courses are available.

5. Understand the concept of a software package, software release, version number (in particular the concept of `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_), deprecation.

   See :ref:`releases` for specific practices used for :mod:`message_ix`.

6. Use the `Anaconda Navigator <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/>`_ graphical interface or the ``conda`` command-line interface (`documentation <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#installing-packages>`__) to install, uninstall, upgrade, and check the versions of Python packages.
   Understand the concept of `conda environments <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html>`_; create, activate, switch, and remove environments.

7. Understand or learn the basic functionality of Python data science packages, including pandas.

   - `Introductory tutorials <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#intro-to-pandas>`__ for pandas.

8. Use a Jupyter notebook to run Python or R code, including: start the notebook server; open, restart, and close notebooks; create and edit cells.

   - `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html>`_ official documentation.
   - Video introductions to the notebook.
     `Example 1 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI>`_ by Michael Fudge (English, 7 minutes)
     `Example 2 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk>`_ by Corey Schafer (English, 30 minutes), both on YouTube.
     Many are available on other platforms.
   - An `in-depth tutorial <https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook>`_ by Karlijn Williams on DataCamp.



Advanced usage
==============
The following items may be more or less.

Domain knowledge
----------------
You should be able to:

1. Understand concepts including:

   - Capacity factor of a power-generating technology.
   - Deprecation.

Scientific computing skills
---------------------------
You should be able to:

1. Interact with a server or ‘headless’ computer, i.e. one without a graphical interface, over the command line, using SSH.

2. Use the ``pip`` command-line interface (`documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#installing-packages>`__) to install, uninstall, upgrade, and check the versions of Python packages.

3. Use the **Git version control system** and the ``git`` command-line tool to clone repositories, pull, fetch, create branches, and push.
   For :doc:`contributing to development <contributing>`, you should know how to:

   - `git merge <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge>`_, i.e. bring all updates from the ``master`` branch into your PR branch, giving you a chance to fix conflicts and make a new commit.
   - `git rebase <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase>`_, i.e. replay your PR branch commits one-by-one, starting from the tip of the ``master`` branch (rather than the original starting commit).

   Optionally, do these things via a graphical program such as GitHub Desktop.

   - The free `Pro Git book <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_.
   - Interactive learning tools on `try.github.io <http://try.github.io/>`_.

4. Understand and interact with repositories and issues on **GitHub**, including:

   - Find and read the list of issues for a repository.
   - Search within one repository or across all of GitHub.
   - Use GitHub's formatting to produce legible descriptions of code and code errors.
   - Understand concepts including: pull request, merge, merge conflict, assign, review.

   See:

   - `Documentation for the GitHub website <https://docs.github.com/en/github>`_
   - `Short introduction to the Github 'flow' <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_, which describes a **pull request** and how it is used.
   - Interactive tools in the `Learning Lab <https://lab.github.com/>`_.

5. Provide a complete and explicit description of a software error message and how to reproduce it.

6. Read and understand GAMS code.
