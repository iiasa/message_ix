Low-carbon investments are necessary for driving the energy system transformation that is called for by both the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.
Improving understanding of the scale and nature of these investments under diverging technology and policy futures is therefore of great importance ...  :doc:`Read more →<../publications/10.1038-s41560-018-0179-z>`

Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 °C describe major transformations in energy supply and ever-rising energy demand.
Here, we provide a contrasting perspective by developing a narrative of future change based on observable trends that results in low energy demand.
We describe and quantify changes in ... :doc:`Read more →<../publications/10.1038-s41560-018-0172-6>`

In tropical climates, the energy consumed by heating, ventilation and air conditioning can exceed 50% of the total energy consumption of a building.
The demand for cooling is rising steadily, driven by global warming and rapidly increasing living standards in developing economies.
In addition, there is a rise ...  :doc:`Read more →<../publications/10.1016-j.scs.2021.103257>`
