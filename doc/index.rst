The |MESSAGEix| framework
*************************

|MESSAGEix| is a versatile, dynamic systems-optimization modelling framework developed by the |IIASA| Energy, Climate, and Environment (ECE) Program [#rename]_ since the 1980s.

This is the documentation for :mod:`message_ix`, a Python package that ties together all components of the framework.
:mod:`message_ix` and :mod:`ixmp` are free and open source, licensed under the `APACHE 2.0 open-source license`_.

- For the scientific reference of the framework, see Huppmann et al. (2019) :cite:`Huppmann-2018`.
- For an overview and recent publications related to the specific |MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM global model instance used at the IIASA ECE Program, see the `MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM documentation`_.

Getting started
===============

.. NB this ReST pattern is repeated throughout this file:

   1. List of :doc:`...` links, followed by
   2. .. toctree:: directive with :hidden:, containing the same links.

   This overcomes limitations of toctree, allowing introductory paragraphs, and different titles in this page than in the sidebar.

Modeling using |MESSAGEix| requires domain knowledge, understanding of certain research methods, and scientific computing skills.

- :doc:`prereqs` gives a list of these items for formal and self-guided learning.

Then, continue with the:

- :doc:`framework` detailed description and feature list.
- :doc:`install` of the software and essential dependencies.
- :doc:`tutorials` for new users that demonstrate the basic features of the framework.
- :doc:`Usage <usage>` of |MESSAGEix| in academic publications, research projects, and derived tools.

Developing |MESSAGEix| models
=============================

Developing a valid, scientific |MESSAGEix| model requires careful use of the framework features.
This section provides guidelines for how to make some common model design choices.

- :doc:`tools/add_year`
- :doc:`reporting`
- :doc:`debugging`
- :doc:`macro`
