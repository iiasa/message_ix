Frequently asked questions 
==========================

What's included in a 'typical' |MESSAGEix| model?
-------------------------------------------------

A typical |MESSAGEix| model instance is based on a suite of technologies such
as power plants, which represent a reference energy system (RES). Each
technology is characterised by its input and output commodities, costs
(investment, fixed and variable components), and other technical/engineering
parameters. The model minimizes the total system cost while meeting a given
demand for energy services or commodities.

Which policies and regulatory measures can be included?
-------------------------------------------------------

The |MESSAGEix| framework can represent a wide range of mitigation options
and policies to analyse transformation pathways. For example, bounds or
taxes on emissions can be defined to shift the system towards a low-emission
technology mix. Upper or lower bounds on deployment of new technologies can
also be easily included.

Under which license is |MESSAGEix| released?
--------------------------------------------

|MESSAGEix| and the |ixmp| (ixmp) are released under the 
`APACHE 2.0 open-source license`_. You are free to use, modify and redistribute
the source code of the framework as long as you clearly indicate any changes.
You must also include the `NOTICE`_ file in any redistributed work.

Can I use |MESSAGEix| for my own analysis?
------------------------------------------

Yes! We invite you to develop your own energy system or integrated assessment model
based on the |MESSAGEix| framework. Please read the `NOTICE`_ for user guidelines
on naming conventions of new models based on |MESSAGEix|.

How can I contribute to the development of the |MESSAGEix| framework?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We use `GitHub`_ for code development and management of issues and bug reports.
In addition, we use a `Google group`_ as a discussion forum and
community mailing list.

I have more questions...
------------------------

Please have a look at the discussion forum at the |MESSAGEix| `Google group`_ - 
maybe your issue has been discussed there already! If not, just send an email
to the community mailing list.
