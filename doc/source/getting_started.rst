Installation
------------

For new users, we recommend to install `Anaconda`_ (Python 3.6 or higher) and
`GAMS`_. Importantly, when installing GAMS, check the box labeled `Use advanced 
installation mode` select `Add GAMS directory to PATH environment variable` on
the Advanced Options page.
   
Then, open a command prompt and type

    ``conda install -c conda-forge message-ix``

For expert users or to install from source, please follow the installation
instructions in the `README`_.
