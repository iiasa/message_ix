Because the model formulation is flexible, users (individuals and groups) of |MESSAGEix| have built a wide variety of concrete models to study research questions in a range of domains and fields.
Model outputs are also used in a variety of ways, notably to inform policy-makers and other stakeholders facing energy systems challenges and decisions.

The list is not exhaustive, but provided to illustrate the wide range of possible applications of |MESSAGEix| for current and prospective users, and also to encourage knowledge exchange within the |MESSAGEix| user community.

Tools
=====

|MESSAGEix| and :mod:`ixmp` provide a robust feature set for modeling.
However, these features are *general-purpose*, so some users have developed additional tools that extend or complement |MESSAGEix| to serve specific use-cases or needs.

.. note:: It is not guaranteed that the tools listed in this section are maintained.
