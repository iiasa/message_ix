h4. lpDiag: simple tool for diagnosis of LP-matrices basic properties.

This is a temporary quick summary of the tool. It will be replaced by a proper documentation.

The initial version developed in March/April 2023 focuses on processing matrices in the MPS format. The gitHub repo contains small MPSs for testing local installations of the tool.
Large MPSs should not be posted in the repo: they should either be tested
locally or posted at /t/fricko/for_marek dir.

Some more details are available in the corresponding Readme.txt files located with the Python code.
