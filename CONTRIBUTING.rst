Contributor Guidelines
======================

We appreciate contributions to the code base and development of new features for the framework. Please `open a new “issue” on Github <https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix/issues/new>`_ to raise questions concerning potential bugs or to propose new features. `Existing open and resolved/closed issues <https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix/issues?q=is:issue>`_ may already contain a solution.

For contributions to the code base of the platform, please `open a GitHub “pull request,” <https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix/pulls>`_ including a detailed description of the new feature and unit tests to illustrate the intended functionality. All pull requests will be reviewed by the message_ix maintainers and/or contributors.

before any pull request can be reviewed. This ensures that all future users can benefit
from your contribution, and that your contributions do not infringe on anyone else's rights.
The electronic signature is collected via the `cla-assistant`_ when issuing the pull request.
