Introduction
------------

This document specifies the guidelines for using the |MESSAGEix| framework and the ix modeling platform.
The aim of these guidelines is to ensure best scientific practice and collaborative development of the platform.

Documentation and further information is available at `MESSAGEix.iiasa.ac.at`_.
The framework is available for download at `github.com/iiasa/message_ix`_.
Please refer to the website and repository for the most up-to-date version of the code base.

The community mailing list for questions and discussions on new features is hosted using Googlegroups.
Please join at `groups.google.com/d/forum/message_ix`_
and use <message_ix@googlegroups.com> to send an email to the |MESSAGEix| user community.

User Guidelines
---------------

A) Reference to the scientific publication and online resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please cite the following manuscript when using the |MESSAGEix| framework and/or the ix modeling platform 
for scientific publications or technical reports:

  Daniel Huppmann, Matthew Gidden, Oliver Fricko, Peter Kolp, 
  Clara Orthofer, Michael Pimmer, Adriano Vinca, Alessio Mastrucci, Keywan Riahi, and Volker Krey. 
  "The |MESSAGEix| Integrated Assessment Model and the ix modeling platform". 2018, submitted. 
  Electronic pre-print available at `pure.iiasa.ac.at/15157/`_.

Also, please include a hyperlink to the online resource `MESSAGEix.iiasa.ac.at`_
in any publication/report, or on a website describing your model
or scientific analysis using the |MESSAGEix| framework.

.. _`pure.iiasa.ac.at/15157/` : https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/15157/

B) Developing new model instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Researchers are welcome to develop new model instances using the |MESSAGEix| framework 
for their own research interests. However, any such model must be named "MESSAGEix xxx" or "MESSAGEix-xxx",
where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the country/region, institutional affiliation or a similar identifying name.
For example, the national model for South Africa developed by Orthofer et al. [1] is called "MESSAGEix South Africa".

Furthermore, please ensure that there is no naming conflict with existing versions of the |MESSAGEix| model family.
When in doubt, please contact the IIASA Energy Program at <message_ix@iiasa.ac.at>.

C) Notice of new publications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We would appreciate a notice of publications using the |MESSAGEix| framework and the ix modeling platform.
Please send an e-mail to <message_ix@iiasa.ac.at>.
